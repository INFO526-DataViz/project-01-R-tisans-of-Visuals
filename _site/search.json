This data set contains information on individual cat characteristics, including age,gender, neuter status and hunting behavior along with timestamped GPS data. Since cats having a fascinating characteristics, our team has chosen to utilize this data set to gain a valuable insights into cat hunting behaviors. We aim to explore whether the number of cats living together has any impact on hunting behavior and whether the reproductive status influences their hunting patterns.\nEach country data set is divided into two subsets. The first subset comprises observations of 11 variables, providing data such as ground speed, geographic longitude and latitude estimated by sensors, time stamps for sensor measurements, and event IDs. The second subset contains observations of 16 variables and primarily describes the number of cats living in a house, whether they are allowed to hunt, their prey per month, the type of food that the cats consume, reproductive condition, and the sex of the animals. For this project, our team has utilize this data to create visualizations aimed at analyzing hunting behavior."

Our interest lies in understanding if the presence of other cats in the same living environment influences the hunting skills and behavior of individual cats. To explore this question, we have aggregated data from different countries into a single data set. We are utilizing four key features from the data set: the number of cats (n_cats), the number of prey caught per month (prey_per_month), the age of the cats, and we are additionally using the feature of the cat’s sex to analyze hunting behavior in relation to gender."

We have categorized the cats into three distinct age groups: kittens (0 to 5 years), young cats (5 to 10 years), and mature cats (above 10 years). The x-axis displays the number of cat data, while the y-axis represents the prey caught per month. The plot is divided into three segments based on age groups. We believe that segmenting the jitter plot by age group is a valuable approach for assessing the hunting capabilities of cats in relation to their age."

To assess hunting abilities based on age, we categorized cats into three groups: kittens, young cats, and mature cats. Figure 1 provides insights into this analysis.\nThe observation from Figure 1 indicates that kittens living alone and those in small groups exhibit superior hunting skills. Notably, the data reveals that cats living alone tend to improve their hunting abilities as they transition from kitten to young age, but this gradually decreases as they mature. Based on the figure, it’s evident that kittens catch approximately 21 prey per month. As they transition to the young age category, the number of prey caught increases to around 28, but it gradually reduces back to 21 when they reach the mature age category. However, Mature cats exhibit diverse hunting success rates, as indicated by the wide range of data in the observations. Additionally, when the number of cats living together exceeds two, the prey caught decreases as the cats age."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nHow does the reproductive status of cats influence the hunting pattern?\nOur second question focuses on finding the hunting patterns based on the reproductive conditions of the cat. Reproductive status can significantly affect the behavior and activity of cats, and this study seeks to understand whether there are any patterns in hunting activities based on whether cats are neutered or not. For answering this question we have some features from the data set which includes the reproductive condition of the animal (animal_reproductive_condition ) which specifies whether the animal was neutered or not, the number of prey caught per month (prey_p_month ), the time cats spends indoors (hrs_indoors)."

In Figure 3, we explore cats’ hunting behavior based on their reproductive condition. To facilitate our analysis, we’ve segmented the data by countries, including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The density plot reveals a consistent trend: neutered cats tend to engage in more hunting across all these countries.\nThe figure 4 offers provides valuable insights into the hunting behavior of cats, with a focus on the impact of age and reproductive status. Notably, it reveals that as cats grow older, regardless of whether they are Fixed or Unneutered, their prey-catching activity decreases. However, the data highlights a fascinating trend among Unneutered cats, particularly those aged 10 to 14 years, who exhibit the highest hunting prowess. It’s intriguing to note that older Unneutered cats, beyond 15 years, seem to be less active hunters, which might imply a decrease in hunting behavior with age. This observation could be due to older cats hunting less or, possibly, a smaller representation of older Unneutered cats in the study. In summary, the cat’s age and reproductive status play a substantial role in influencing their hunting habits, with younger Unneutered cats being the most proficient hunters, while older cats, regardless of reproductive status, tend to hunt less as they age."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\n\nCats that live in group have a lower hunting spree compared to loner cats. Reasons might be old age, unavailability of cat doors or easy access to food and care by a cat-loving owner.\nFemale cats often have a decline in hunting capacities when living in group with other cats, unless they have access to cat door and they are young.\nNeutered cats show a high spree for hunting compared to Unneutered cats.\nAlthough age is a major factor in a cat’s hunting abilities, neutered cats manage to hunt more than the unneutered cats of equal age.\nThere weren’t much cats in NZ and US that were unneutered, which holds our insights back from exploring their hunting behavior for the said conditions."

    "text": "Challenges faced\n\n\nOur initial analysis plan included exploring ground speed while hunting for every individual cat in the dataset. Later it was discovered that there is no information on ground speed for cats in New Zealand. This would have been an interesting correlation.\nThe lack of data on unneutered cats (owing to the strict neutering policies in some countries) made the insights on the hunting pattern for unneutered cats too limited.\nThere were major chunk of missing values in the dataset coming from New Zealand and Australia. It was handled by imputation techniques. The veracity for the technique is tested by implementing various models and implementing data sampling to get accuracy in the process.\nThe variables that could be a part of the analysis were less. Hence, coming up with a combination of variables that accurately depict our insights was a challenge.\nThere were specific outliers in the data which needed to be explained, in order to justify the relations derived from the dataset. There were additional notes in the raw dataset that helped in analyzing the outliers of the data. The outliers are explained with annotations respectively."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nQuestion 1\n\nThe first question is about studying whether the cats who live in group have the ability to hunt better than the cats who live alone. To analyze the above question we will consider four features from the dataset: n_cats (number of cats living in the house), avg_ground_speed (the average speed of entire tracking period), prey_p_month (prey caught per month), age_years (cat’s age). All of these variables are already present in the dataset except avg_ground_speed, which will be derived from the geo-tagged dataset using data feature manipulation. The geo-tagged dataset cats_uk.csv contains the ground speed of the cat (referenced with tag_id) for each day it was tracked (and went outside). We will take the average of those values of speed for each cat, and create a new column in the reference dataset called avg_ground_speed.\nWe chose to add “age” (years) and “ground_speed” because it gives a varied dynamic on the cat’s hunting abilities. Ground speed shows how fast the cat hunts, and age is an indirect factor of the cat’s experience.\nWe will then use a Bubble Chart to visualize the relationships between these variables effectively. In our bubble chart the values are encoded as:\n\n1) number of cats on the x-axis\n2) prey caught per month on the y-axis,\n3) The size of each bubble will correspond to the values of average ground speed and\n4) The color of the bubbles will be determined by the age of the cats.\n\nA Violin plot can also be a suitable plot here, but the information gain will be apparent only upon actual experiments with data and visualization.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\nThe second question asks whether there is a difference in the hunting pattern based on the reproductive condition of the cat. The dataset contains animal_reproductive_condition that specifies whether the animal was neutered or not. We also have prey_p_month and hrs_indoors that reflect how much time a cat spends indoors or outdoors hunting.\nWe are planning to go with a Parallel Plot or a Line Chart that will effectively compare the three variables together.\n\n1) Two of the axes of either graph will contain the numeric variables prey_p_month and hrs_indoors.\n2) The third categorical variable will help further to categorize (differentiate) the groups in the plot.\n\nThis visualization will be finalized based on the amount of information retrieval from either if the charts mentioned in the above point."
