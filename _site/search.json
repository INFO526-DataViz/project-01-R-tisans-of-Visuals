This data set contains information on individual cat characteristics, including age,gender, neuter status and hunting behaviour along with timestamped GPS data. Since cats having a fascinating characteristics, our team has chosen to utilize this data set to gain a valuable insights into cat hunting bhaviours. We aim to explore whether the number of cats living together has any impact on hunting behavior and whether the reproductive status influences their hunting patterns.\nEach country data set is divided into two subsets. The first subset comprises observations of 11 variables, providing data such as ground speed, geographic longitude and latitude estimated by sensors, timestamps for sensor measurements, and event IDs. The second subset contains observations of 16 variables and primarily describes the number of cats living in a house, whether they are allowed to hunt, their prey per month, the type of food that the cats consume, reproductive condition, and the sex of the animals. For this project, our team has utilize this data to create visualizations aimed at analyzing hunting behavior."

Our interest lies in understanding if the presence of other cats in the same living environment influences the hunting skills and behavior of individual cats. To explore this question, we have aggregated data from different countries into a single data set. We are utilizing four key features from the data set: the number of cats (n_cats), the number of prey caught per month (prey_per_month), the age of the cats, and we are additionally using the feature of the cat‚Äôs sex to analyze hunting behavior in relation to gender."

The x-axis displays the number of cat data, while the y-axis represents the prey caught per month. The plot is divided into three segments based on age groups. We believe that segmenting the scatterplot by age group is a valuable approach for assessing the hunting capabilities of cats in relation to their age."

Reproductive status can significantly affect the behavior and activity of cats, and this study seeks to understand whether there are any patterns in hunting activities based on whether cats are neutered or not. For answering this question we have some features from the data set which includes the reproductive condition of the animal (animal_reproductive_condition ) which specifies whether the animal was neutered or not, the number of prey caught per month (prey_p_month ), the time cats spends indoors (hrs_indoors)."

The data reveals that cats, especially those categorized as ‚ÄúKittens‚Äù, excel in hunting when they are either alone or in a group of no more than 2, capturing a rate that often falls between 10 and 20 prey monthly.\nAs the group size surpasses two cats, there‚Äôs a noticeable dip in hunting efficiency, most prominently seen in the ‚ÄúYoung‚Äù age bracket where many data points hover below 10 captures per month.\n\n\n\nThe ‚ÄúMature‚Äù cats display a wide spread in their data, indicating varied hunting success rates. In summation, the chart suggests that kittens, when hunting solo or in pairs, tend to outperform larger groups, particularly when pitted against groups of young cats."
