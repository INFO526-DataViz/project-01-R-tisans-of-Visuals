    "text": "Plot and text\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot showcases the hunting prowess of cats in relation to their group size and age. The data reveals that cats, especially those categorized as “Kittens”, excel in hunting when they are either alone or in a group of no more than 2, capturing a rate that often falls between 10 and 20 prey monthly.\nAs the group size surpasses two cats, there’s a noticeable dip in hunting efficiency, most prominently seen in the “Young” age bracket where many data points hover below 10 captures per month.\n\n\n\nThe “Mature” cats display a wide spread in their data, indicating varied hunting success rates. In summation, the chart suggests that kittens, when hunting solo or in pairs, tend to outperform larger groups, particularly when pitted against groups of young cats."
