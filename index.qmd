## Abstract

Our project aims on analyzing cat hunting behaviors. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are a subject of conservation concern due to their annual predation of billions of native prey. However, the ecological significance of these pets as predators lacks clarity when spatial context is not taken into account \[1\]. Our data set consist of pet cats hunting details from different countries. Our project aims to address two key questions: Do cats living together exhibit hunting skills better than solitary cats and does the reproductive status of cats affects their hunting behavior.

## Introduction

Our team decided to anlysis the Pet Cats data set comes from Movebank for Animal Tracking Data, collected from volunteers using GPS sensors on their pet cats around UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. This data set contains information on individual cat characteristics, including age,gender, neuter status and hunting behaviour along with timestamped GPS data. Since cats having a fascinating characteristics, our team has chosen to utilize this data set to gain a valuable insights into cat hunting bhaviours. We aim to explore whether the number of cats living together has any impact on hunting behavior and whether the reproductive status influences their hunting patterns.

Each country data set is divided into two subsets. The first subset comprises observations of 11 variables, providing data such as ground speed, geographic longitude and latitude estimated by sensors, timestamps for sensor measurements, and event IDs. The second subset contains observations of 16 variables and primarily describes the number of cats living in a house, whether they are allowed to hunt, their prey per month, the type of food that the cats consume, reproductive condition, and the sex of the animals. For this project, our team has utilize this data to create visualizations aimed at analyzing hunting behavior.
