    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nQuestion 1\n\nThe first question is about studying whether the cats who live in group have the ability to hunt better than the cats who live alone. To analyze the above question we will consider some features from the dataset: n_cats (number of cats living in the house), prey_p_month (prey caught per month), age_years (cat‚Äôs age). We have categorized the cats into three distinct age groups: kittens (0 to 5 years), young cats (5 to 10 years), and mature cats (above 10 years). The x-axis displays the number of cat data, while the y-axis represents the prey caught per month. The plot is divided into three segments based on age groups. We believe that segmenting the jitter plot by age group is a valuable approach for assessing the hunting capabilities of cats in relation to their age.\nWe will then use a jitter plot to visualize the relationships between these variables effectively. In our plot the values are encoded as:\n\nnumber of cats on the x-axis\nprey caught per month on the y-axis,\npoints on the plot will be grouped by age.\n\nA line plot can also be a suitable plot here, but the information gain will be apparent only upon actual experiments with data and visualization.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\nThe second question asks whether there is a difference in the hunting pattern based on the reproductive condition of the cat. The dataset contains animal_reproductive_condition that specifies whether the animal was neutered or not. We also have prey_p_month and age that reflect the hunting pattern with respect to age.\nWe are planning to go with a Ridgeline Plot or a Hexbin Plot that will effectively compare the three variables together.\n\nTwo of the axes of either graph will contain the numeric variables prey_p_month and hrs_indoors.\nThe third categorical variable will help further to categorize (differentiate) the groups in the plot.\n\nThis visualization will be finalized based on the amount of information retrieval from either if the charts mentioned in the above point."

Our interest lies in understanding if the presence of other cats in the same living environment influences the hunting skills and behavior of individual cats. To explore this question, we have aggregated data from different countries into a single data set. We are utilizing four key features from the data set: the number of cats (n_cats), the number of prey caught per month (prey_per_month), the age of the cats, and we are additionally using the feature of the cat‚Äôs sex to analyze hunting behavior in relation to gender."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe primary goal of our initial question was to understand the hunting behavior of cats living together compared to those living alone. To assess hunting abilities based on age, we categorized cats into three groups: kittens, young cats, and mature cats. Figure 1 provides insights into this analysis.\nThe observation from Figure 1 indicates that kittens living alone and those in small groups exhibit superior hunting skills. Notably, the data reveals that cats living alone tend to improve their hunting abilities as they transition from kitten to young age, but this gradually decreases as they mature. Based on the figure, it‚Äôs evident that kittens catch approximately 21 prey per month. As they transition to the young age category, the number of prey caught increases to around 28, but it gradually reduces back to 21 when they reach the mature age category. However, Mature cats exhibit diverse hunting success rates, as indicated by the wide range of data in the observations. Additionally, when the number of cats living together exceeds two, the prey caught decreases as the cats age.\nPlot 2 provides an illustration of the hunting efficiency of cats, comparing those that live alone to those in groups, with a focus on gender. The dispersion of data points indicates variations in hunting abilities among both male and female cats. The figure reveals that male cats living alone tend to be more efficient hunters, with an average of up to 11 prey per month. There is one notable exception where female cats outperform in hunting, and that is when they have access to a cat door. On average, male cats appear to outperform female cats in terms of prey caught per month."

Reproductive status can significantly affect the behavior and activity of cats, and this study seeks to understand whether there are any patterns in hunting activities based on whether cats are neutered or not. For answering this question we have some features from the data set which includes the reproductive condition of the animal (animal_reproductive_condition ) which specifies whether the animal was neutered or not, the number of prey caught per month (prey_p_month ), the time cats spends indoors (hrs_indoors)."

Here we are considering four different countries and they are: UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. To conduct this analysis, we encountered missing values in the dataset that were crucial for our research. As a solution, we performed some data sampling. Specifically, the prey caught per month data was missing for the country New Zealand, and we addressed this by filling the gaps with the average mean value. This approach allowed us to gain insights into how reproductive status influences the hunting behavior of cats, even in the presence of missing data.\nFor the second plot, we employed a hexbin plot to examine the influence of reproductive status on hunting patterns in cats, particularly concerning age. The x-axis represents the prey caught per month, while the y-axis represents the age of the cat. The plot features data points representing neutered and fixed cats, allowing us to visualize how reproductive status relates to hunting behavior in different age groups."

    "text": "Discussion 2\nThe plot provides valuable insights into the hunting behavior of cats, with a focus on the impact of age and reproductive status. In Figure 1, we explore cats‚Äô hunting behavior based on their reproductive condition. To facilitate our analysis, we‚Äôve segmented the data by countries, including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The ridgeline plot reveals a consistent trend: neutered cats tend to engage in more hunting across all these countries. The majority of the data falls within the range of the 25th and 50th quantiles. However, it‚Äôs important to note that there is a lack of unneutered data for the countries New Zealand and the United States. This data gap should be considered when interpreting the results for these specific countries. Cats in the US and UK tend to catch less prey per month compared to their counterparts in AUS and NZ. This could be due to various factors such as differences in local ecosystems, cat populations, or even cultural attitudes towards outdoor cats.\nThe reproductive condition of cats seems to have a significant impact on their hunting habits. Fixed cats tend to catch higher amount of prey than unneutered ones. We can see that the first and second quantiles for fixed cats across AUS and UK hold majority of cats than that for unneutered cats. This could be due to hormonal changes or behavioral differences associated with these conditions.\nThe figure 2 offers provides valuable insights into the hunting behavior of cats, with a focus on the impact of age and reproductive status. Notably, it reveals that as cats grow older, their prey-catching activity decreases. However, the data highlights a fascinating trend among Fixed cats, particularly those aged 6 to 12 years, who exhibit the highest hunting prowess. It‚Äôs intriguing to note that older Unneutered cats, beyond 12 years become less active hunters, which might imply a decrease in hunting behavior with age and reproductive condition. The highest prey caught by an unneutered cat is far less than a fixed cat of equivalent age.\nThis observation could be a smaller representation of older Unneutered cats in the study or possibly due to older unneutered cats hunting less. In summary, the cat‚Äôs age and reproductive status play a substantial role in influencing their hunting habits, with younger Fixed cats being the most proficient hunters."

    "text": "Challenges faced\n\n\nOur initial analysis plan included exploring ground speed while hunting for every individual cat in the dataset. Later it was discovered that there is no information on ground speed for cats in New Zealand. This would have been an interesting correlation.\nThe lack of data on unneutered cats (owing to the strict neutering policies in some countries) made the insights on the hunting pattern for unneutered cats too limited.\nThere were major chunk of missing values in the dataset coming from New Zealand and Australia. It was handled by imputation techniques. The veracity for the technique is tested by implementing various models and implementing data sampling to get accuracy in the process.\nThe variables that could be a part of the analysis were less. Hence, coming up with a combination of variables that accurately depict our insights was a challenge.\nThere were specific outliers in the data which needed to be explained, in order to justify the relations derived from the dataset. There were additional notes in the raw dataset that helped in analyzing the outliers of the data. The outliers are explained with annotations respectively."
