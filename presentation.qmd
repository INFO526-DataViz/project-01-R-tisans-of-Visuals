## Dataset Description

::: incremental
-   Dataset is drawn from TidyTuesday

-   The **Pet Cats** data set comes from [**Movebank for Animal Tracking Data**](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.882), collected from volunteers using GPS sensors on their pet cats around *UK, US, Australia and New Zealand*.

-   The dataset from US,UK,Australia,New Zealand have been merged to form a new data set which is used for plotting is

## Text

-   Kittens excel in hunting , especially when living alone or in pairs, capturing between 10 and 20 prey monthly.

-   Hunting efficiency declines as group size exceeds two, particularly among young cats which often capture less than 10 prey monthly.

-   Mature cats show varied hunting success rates, with a broad spread in the data.

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
#penguins |> 
  #head() |>
  #kableExtra::kable() |>
 # kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

    $$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
