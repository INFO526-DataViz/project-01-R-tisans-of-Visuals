Cats who haven't been neutered tend to be better hunters in both Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\n-    Notably, in the US and New Zealand, data for unneutered cats is absent, among the displayed data, neutered cats in the US tend to catch slightly more prey, indicating that the effects of neutering on hunting abilities can vary by region.\n\n# Plot 2\n\n## Code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncats_new |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = prey_p_month, y = age_years, \n             color=animal_reproductive_condition)) + \n  geom_hex(bins=15, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_hex(data = cats_new |> \n             filter(animal_reproductive_condition == \"Unneutered\"), \n           bins = 15, \n           fill = \"maroon4\", \n           color = \"maroon4\",\n           show.legend = TRUE) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 9.3, color=\"maroon4\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 12.9, color=\"maroon4\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"white\", \"black\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,30,2)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,24,4)) + \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"pink2\", high = \"salmon2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How are cats impacted by their reproductive condition?\",\n    subtitle =  \"Observed w.r.t the age of the cat\",\n    caption = \"Q 2 | Plot 2\",\n    x = \"Prey caught per month\",\n    y = \"Age of the cat\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"top\", legend.justification = \"right\"\n  ) + \n  guides(\n    color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = c(\"pink2\", \"maroon4\"),\n                                             color = c(\"white\", \"black\")),\n                         title = \"reproductive condition\"\n                         )\n  ) + \n  annotate(\"label\", \n           x = 21, y = 15,\n           label = expression(italic(\"spends only 2hrs inside\")),\n           size = 2.5,\n           color = \"maroon4\",\n           fontface = \"bold\",\n           fill = alpha(c(\"white\"),0.2)\n                  ) + \n  annotate(\"text\",\n           x = 12, y = 18,\n           label = expression(italic(\"prey = 9\")),\n           size = 3,\n           color = \"black\",\n           fontface = \"bold\"\n                  ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", \n           x = 27, y = 13.5,\n           label = expression(italic(\"age = 12\")),\n           size = 3,\n           color = \"black\",\n           fontface = \"bold\"\n                  ) +\n  coord_fixed() \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Insights\n\n-   As cats age, they generally catch less prey, regardless of being Fixed or Unneutered.\n\n-   Unneutered cats aged 10-14 years are the most proficient hunters.\n\n-   Older unneutered cats catch fewer prey compared to their younger selves.\n\n-   Data is limited on unneutered cats over 15 years old, suggesting they might hunt less or are underrepresented in the study.\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Conclusion {.smaller background-image=\"images/front_bg.png\" background-size=\"cover\"}\n\n<div>\n\n-   Cats that live in group have a lower hunting spree compared to loner cats. Reasons might be old age, unavailability of cat doors or easy access to food and care by a cat-loving owner.\n\n-   Female cats often have a decline in hunting capacities when living in group with other cats, unless they have access to cat door and they are young.\n\n-   Neutered cats show a high spree for hunting compared to Unneutered cats.\n\n-   Although age is a major factor in a cat's hunting abilities, neutered cats manage to hunt more than the unneutered cats of equal age.\n\n-   There weren't much cats in NZ and US that were unneutered, which holds our insights back from exploring their hunting behavior for the said conditions.\n\n</div>\n\n## Challenges faced {.smaller}\n\n<div>\n\n-   Our initial analysis plan included exploring ground speed while hunting for every individual cat in the dataset. Later it was discovered that there is no information on ground speed for cats in New Zealand. This would have been an interesting correlation.\n\n-   The lack of data on unneutered cats (owing to the strict neutering policies in some countries) made the insights on the hunting pattern for unneutered cats too limited.\n\n-   There were major chunk of missing values in the dataset coming from New Zealand and Australia. It was handled by imputation techniques. The veracity for the technique is tested by implementing various models and implementing data sampling to get accuracy in the process.\n\n-   The variables that could be a part of the analysis were less. Hence, coming up with a combination of variables that accurately depict our insights was a challenge.\n\n-   There were specific outliers in the data which needed to be explained, in order to justify the relations derived from the dataset. There were additional notes in the raw dataset that helped in analyzing the outliers of the data. The outliers are explained with annotations respectively.\n\n</div>\n",
